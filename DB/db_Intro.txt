DBMS - is a software to store informantion to do CRUD operation on data.

CRUD - create,read,update,delete


Non - RelationDB - anything that is non relational for eg, api response in JSON, Documents,Graphs
1. mongoDB,dynamoDb,cassandra,firebase

Relation DB - all data inside table and keys

1. mysql,oracle,postgreSQL

SQL - strucutral query lang.


DB- Query => query are request made to the db managment system for specific info.


Student     Column `||`

StudentID   name    major
1           jack    biology      <== ROW
2           kate    sociology   
3           claire  english 
4           jack    biology
5           mike    comp. sci


Primary key = something we need to identify seperately for evey row or every table 
                as in above we needed for "JACK" we have 2 jack in same field.
(number or string or anything can be a key depend on use)

as in unique key for like UUID or emp_id(employment_ID) these are called surrogate key which as no mapping to real world but can be use as primariy key to handle uniqueness in table

* Foreign key - attribute that can help to link us to another table () and Foreign key is primary key of another table but it is use to link tables(Relationsip b/w tables).

so For example

employ_Table                                              Branch_table

emp_id firstname branch-id   supervise_id                branch_id   branchname    mgr_id
100    jan       1              Null                         1       scranton        100
101    may       1              100                          2       jojowa          102
102    harry     2              100                          3       nunua           103
103    rah       3              101


Here we have 2 people in branch 1 i.e - 100,101,102,103
we can see in another table to branch that they are from scranton so branch_id here is Foreign key.
and from that Branch table we can see that branch manager is 100 

This is relationalship with the table due to Foreign Key.

* so in supervise_id you can see that may and harry are working under jan
